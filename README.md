# Idea

For this lab I use a dataset from New York City representing census tracts.

# Requirements

* Only one layer exists.
* Is classified by area of tract. With lowest opacity being area 0 and highest opacity having area 10 million sqft.
* Can classify color using borough by clicking top most button.
* Popup for tract on hover. Popup removes after leaving tract. Is glitched since hovering mouse where the popup will be causes the popup to not appear. Not sure how to fix.
* Border thickening on tract hover. Returns to normal after leaving tract.
* Visualization of layer changes by clicking both buttons. First button as described in prior point. Second button choses a random color to use for monochrome.
* Map controls for zoom.
