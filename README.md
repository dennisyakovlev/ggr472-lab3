# Idea

For this lab I use a dataset from New York City representing census tracts.

# Requirements

* Only one layer exists.
* Is classified by area of tract. With lowest opacity being area 0 and highest opacity having area 10 million sqft.
* Can classify color using borough by clicking top most button.
* Visualization of layer changes by clicking both buttons. First button as described in prior point. Second button choses a random color to use for monochrome.
* Map controls for zoom.
